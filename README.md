# ListaFX

## About project

Basically, it's a desktop client for [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) website. I am using their RESTful API for connecting to the database, authentication, managing user's list, searching the database and stuff like that. I know that not everyone likes anime, but I made this project mainly for myself and I've been using it since the beginning. Plus I learned a lot of course.

## Technology

I used JavaFX here, because it was something new to me, something unknown and I just wanted to give it a try. Besides that I used:
- [ControlsFX](http://fxexperience.com/controlsfx/) library for enhanced ui components
- [JSoup](https://jsoup.org/) for parsing XML data
- [Trello](https://trello.com/) for managing TODOs

## Code

This project is one of the first on which I worked for an extended period of time. I am a beginner, thus I am making lots of mistakes in my code and app design, but I have that in mind. That's why I am constantly looking for opportunities to improve. The codebase went through many big refactoring processes, but I am still not quite happy about it. 

## Screenshots

I've worked with css files to achieve a black and red design. Other people said that it's ugly. I just wanted to play around with css some day. I don't have a talent for designing UIs.
